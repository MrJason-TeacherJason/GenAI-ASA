# Gen AI ASA Week 04 - Tools

Last week we looked at prompting, using keyboard shortcuts, and spoke about pivoting. I also got us to pivot on our final project. Instead of me telling you what to create, I asked you to use a chatbot to help you find a final project to work on.

The goal is simple. Produce a product that shows your learning in this ASA.

At the end of the lesson all of you found a project to work on. Every project has a coding component. Hence, today we will briefly look at a set of tools to use when working on a coding project. Additionally, I will use this opportunity to review and introduce new vocabulary and technology concepts. For example, to create your final project you will ***vibe code***.

## Lesson Outline

- Introduction
- What all projects have in common
- What tools we will use
- Install and setup our tools

## Our Projects

All projects require an AI tool to generate code. At first we will generate code with a chatbot using its app interface in a browser. Next week, we will use **Cursor** to generate our code directly in an ***IDE***.

## Tools

Let's quickly touch on our tools. So far, we have only used a ***browser*** to access a ***chatbot***. Our choice of browser is terrible from a ***privacy*** standpoint, as **Chrome** is a commercial product harvesting user data for profit. Hence, ther is zero privacy, even with the most locked down settings.

### Browser

A ***browser*** is an application used to access the ***web*** (unfortunately, most view the web and the ***internet*** as one and the same, which is far from the truth). While choice is limited, there are two choices that stand out supporting privacy. One is built with the Firefox rendering engine and utilising the Onion network, the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/). The other I want you to install today is the [Brave browser](https://brave.com/). It leaves no finger print, blocks all trackers (unless otherwise instructed), and has a solid rendering engine using the [Chromium web browser](https://www.chromium.org/blink/) (the [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) code powering the **Chrome Browser**).

### Source Code Control System

We will use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as our ***source code control system***, as it has become an industry standard. The code of our projects will be hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a popular provider of hosting services utilising **Git**. These systems are quite complex, and we won't delve in to them much. We will learn enough about them to host our ***source code*** ***remotely***, and maintain different ***versions*** of our projects.

Most modern ***IDE*** and ***editors*** provide Git (and GitHub) integration.

### Integrated Developer Environments (IDE)

***Integrated developer environments*** or ***IDE***s for short, are where we work on our project's codebase.

At our school, we teach [Python](https://www.python.org/) using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as the IDE. I want you to get used to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it can be used with [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), which we will use next week.

## Today's Task

1) Open **Code**
2) Generate some test code in your ***chatbot*** of choice
3) Copy-paste the code into your editor and get it to run
4) If you have setup a GitHub account, upload your code to GitHub using the browser interface
