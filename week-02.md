# Gen AI ASA - Week 02
## Warm-Up
Last ASA, we spoke about…

- Our expectations
- What we will produce (final product)
- Safety in context of online activities
- Never trust anyone online, unless they are sitting right next to you and you can see them using a device to communicate with you
- Trust and honesty are great in person, but are misplaced in cyberspace (the online world)
- We need to separate our real life from our online life
- For this program, you will have a separate, special email account to use for all things Gen AI ASA related 
- We tried to use an AI chatbot to see if we could create a character to represent us to network with others and present a set of - skills and interests while preserving a level of anonymity 
- Keeping our identity secret protects us and those around us safe
- ***HOMEWORK:** create a free email account*

## Today's Agenda
1. Test our dedicated new emails
	a. If necessary, set up a new account with [Proton](https://proton.me/mail)
2. Setup accounts with
	a. [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)
	b. [ChatPGT](https://chatgpt.com/)
Get advice from both chatbots and compare

## Today's Prompt
We need to be clearer and detailed in our instructions to get the best result. We can even use the chatbot to help us improve our Prompt.

This is a journey of discovery. There is no best Prompt, just great prompting strategies that help us get as close as possible to an ideal of a best prompt.

Technology constantly changes. Mostly driven by the desire to build a better product. What works one week, might not work in the future. We have to constantly reflect and verify our approach, and determine what we could change to get a better result.

```TXT
I need you to be well versed in privacy and security matters concerning protecting our individual
privacy and anonymity, while at the same time connecting with people of similar interests. I want
to develop a character for a digital avatar and then create a portfolio website to connect with
people anonymously. I need you to help me with this. Let’s start with developing the right prompt
to achieve my goals. Please ask me any clarifying questions you might have so that we will arrive
at the most optimal prompt to start on my character generation journey using generative AI.
