# Project Development Chat

## Prompt

Please help me design a project to demonstrate my learning in a course at primary school to demonstrate my knowledge of using AI and keeping my personal details safe with privacy in mind.

## Accepted Output
Project: The Data Detective Game Board
This project streamlines the core concepts into a single, high-impact artifact that is both creative and easy to present.

1. The Project Artifact: A Game Board
What to Make: A simple, custom-made board game that demonstrates how sharing data can lead to positive results (AI learning) or negative risks (loss of privacy). Use a large piece of cardstock or a folded poster board.

Theme: You are a "Data Detective" trying to navigate the internet safely.

2. Game Components
A. The Data Cards (Your Demonstration of AI & Data)
Create two types of cards for the players to draw, each a different color:

"Safe Share" Cards (Green): Information that is generally safe for an AI to use.

Examples: "I like the color blue." "I enjoy playing outside." "My favorite animal is a penguin."

"Private Detail" Cards (Red): Personal information that should never be shared with an unknown app or AI.

Examples: "My address is 123 School Road." "My full name is [Your Name]." "My school is [Your School Name]." "My mom's phone number."

The AI Learning Spots: On the game board, include a few spots labeled "AI Prediction!" When a player lands here, they draw a "Safe Share" card. You explain: "The AI learned you like penguins, so it gives you an ad for a penguin toy!" (This shows AI is just a prediction engine).

B. The Power-Up & Risk Spaces (Your Demonstration of Privacy & Safety)
Design the game path with spaces that teach specific safety rules:

Power-Up! (Move 3 Spaces): "You created a strong password with symbols and numbers. Your account is safe!" (Demonstrates knowledge of password safety).

Risk! (Go Back 2 Spaces): "You shared your favorite ice cream flavor AND your street name. You made a bad combination! Always keep private details secret."

Ask an Adult (Take another turn): "You aren't sure if an app is safe. You ask your teacher or parent. Smart move!" (Highlights the need for trusted adults).

3. Presentation Plan (The 5-Minute Pitch)
Your presentation focuses on walking the judge through the game, explaining the learning goals for each part.

Project Part	What it Demonstrates
Drawing Green Cards	AI Learning: Shows AI needs data to work and makes predictions based on what you share.
Drawing Red Cards	Privacy Protection: Shows what never to share (PII: Personally Identifiable Information).
"Power-Up" Space	Digital Safety Skill: Demonstrates how to make a strong password.
"Ask an Adult" Space	Responsible Use: Shows that safe technology use means getting help when you are unsure.
